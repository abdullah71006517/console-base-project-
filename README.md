Project Title: Inventory Management System
Description
This repository contains an Inventory Management System implemented in C, aimed at demonstrating the practical application of data structures and algorithms learned during my recent Data Structures course. The project focuses on the efficient management of products within an inventory, allowing users to add, update, remove, search, and display products. It also includes functionalities for processing orders and generating reports on inventory status.

Features
Add Product: Allows users to add new products to the inventory, including product ID, name, category, quantity, and price.
Update Product: Enables updating the quantity and price of existing products based on their ID.
Remove Product: Facilitates the removal of products from the inventory using their ID.
Search Product: Allows users to search for a specific product and display its details.
Display Inventory: Shows a list of all products in the inventory.
Sort Inventory: Sorts products based on their names for easier navigation.
Process Order: Handles customer orders, updating product quantities accordingly.
Generate Report: Provides a summary of total items in stock and the overall inventory value.
Data Structures Used
Linked List: For managing the inventory dynamically, allowing easy addition and removal of products.
Structures: To define the Product data type, encapsulating relevant product information.
